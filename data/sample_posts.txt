I keep thinking about the same thing over and over. Maybe it doesn't mean anything.
Why does everything feel so loud lately. The city never sleeps and neither do I.
Found another old photo. Who was I then. Does it even matter.
Sometimes I wonder if we're all just waiting for something that never comes.
Coffee again. Third one today. The days blur together.
I used to believe in signs. Now I just believe in noise.
That song came on and I had to stop. Memory is a trap.
Nobody really knows anyone. We just know versions. Fragments.
I'm not sad. I'm not happy. I'm just here. Is that okay.
The algorithm keeps showing me the same things. It knows something I don't.
Maybe the rabbit hole is just another way of saying we're lost.
I wrote a letter I'll never send. To who. To me. To no one.
Sleep is a rumor. Rest is a myth. Tomorrow is the same as today.
We're all building something. Or digging. Hard to tell the difference sometimes.
