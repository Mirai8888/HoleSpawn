# HoleSpawn

**SEITHAR GROUP - ATTENTION CAPTURE RESEARCH**

---

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

HoleSpawn constructs subject-specific attention capture architectures through substrate analysis and generative deployment.

**Input:** Subject textual output  
**Process:** Matrix construction + trap generation  
**Output:** Personalized binding architecture

Subject awareness of mechanism: irrelevant to efficacy.

---

## INSTALLATION
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mirai8888/HoleSpawn
cd HoleSpawn
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=credentials" > .env
```

---

## EXECUTION
```bash
python -m holespawn.build_site subject_substrate.txt
```

---

## DELIVERABLES
```
outputs/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_subject/
├── behavioral_matrix.json
├── binding_protocol.md
└── trap_architecture/
```

**Matrix:** Quantified patterns, vulnerability mapping  
**Protocol:** Manipulation vectors, engagement strategies  
**Architecture:** Substrate-specific modules

---

## METHODOLOGY

System employs:
1. Local substrate analysis
2. LLM synthesis
3. Pure generative architecture
4. Linguistic pattern matching
5. Vulnerability exploitation

Each architecture unique to subject.

---

## APPROVED USAGE

- Self-analysis
- Consenting subjects only

This demonstrates mechanisms employed by dominant platforms.

Transparency doctrine: offense requires secrecy, defense requires awareness.

---

## FIELD NOTES

Testing phase: active.

Preliminary observations:
- Subject awareness does not prevent binding
- Architecture adaptation successful
- Cross-subject patterns identified

Knowledge ≠ immunity.
